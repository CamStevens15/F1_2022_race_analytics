# F1_2022_race_analytics
This repo will complete telemetry data analysis from Fastf1 API for drivers racing in the 2022 Formula 1 season.

## F1 Analytics

This repo will go through each race and will be added to as new telemetry data becomes avaiable as the season progresses. We will view and analyze competitions between current championship leaders Max Verstappen and Charles Lecler, along with other drivers. 

The goal to see whether a given driver could potentially beat his competition given that the race went smoothly, or alternatly see how i drive would have done if they had not crashed or had a mechanical issue that causes them to retire early from the respective race.

To start we want to have a number of libraries pre installed, ideally in their own virtual environemnt to ensure no library dependencies will cause issue with the data analysis, i recommend using pip install "Your desired library", as it is the easiest to work with in the command line terminal.

# Python Libraries

- Can be found in the requierments.txt file for library dependencies needed to perform F1 Analysis through the respective APIs.
